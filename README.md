# Dataify

This project was built with `create-react-app` to display your recent favorite artists and tracks on Spotify. It also allows you to upload your streaming data if you download it from Spotify and search artists/tracks to get total time and dates listened (something the Spotify API doesn't offer).

There is also an About page that talks about the project and data tracking from Spotify and in general. The project can be found at https://dataify.herokuapp.com/. Try it for yourself!
